# pretty-fractals ðŸ”¥ A collection of fractals that I've made with code

Collection of some really beautiful, serene fractals.

These demonstrate in some cases the idea of compilation, the idea of compiler optimisation.

### Eye Candy

1. $cos(z^2 - c)$ 9.9M

2. $z^2 + c$ 924.7K

4. $cot(z^2-c)$ 148.7K -- Heart warming

There are some other interesting renders(.bmp format) inside mandelbrot/images.zip. Fell free to observe calmly.
